# Contributing

Thank you for even considering contributing to this project! The community around Ember is great and I want this project to be built for the community and as much by it as possible. I want to make it as easy for you to contribute as possible. Here are some things you need to know.

## Start with an Issue

If there is an issue that you want to work on, make a comment on it that you are interested. We can then let you know the status of that issue and if it would be good for you to work on that.

If there is no Issue for what you want to work on, you can create an issue.  When creating an issue, make sure you use our template.  The template has 2 parts - one for a bug and one for a feature.  Just find the section related to your issue type and delete the other from the template.

Try to be as thorough as possible in your issues so that others can understand it.

## Fork it and create a Branch

Use your own fork and branch to work off of.  Try to make helpful git commit messages so it is clear what each step in your process did.

## Code styling

Please make your code clean and readable.  Use proper spacing (2 spaces).  Make sure it passes jshint.

## Writing tests

Make sure you write tests for whatever you add in.

## Submitting a PR

Before you submit a PR, squash all your commits into one commit and then make a PR for your branch to master of this repo. Make sure to follow the pull request template so that those reviewing can have a good sense of what the PR accomplishes and how it does it.

## Let's learn together

Thanks again for contributing. I hope that with us working together we can make the Ember and development communities better.

## First Time Contributers

I'm all about helping those who are first getting started. Don't be scared, just find an issue, make comments and we'll talk. I'd love to help you along the way!
